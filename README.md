Configuration file parameters:

DaysSinceDateCreated: Number of days to use to exclude computers that may have been recently created; This parameter is only used if the DisableUnusedComputers parameter is set to yes
- If not specified and the DisabledUnusedComputers parameter is set to yes, the default is 7 days

DaysSinceLastLogon: Number of days after a 14-day period (2 weeks) to use to search for computers that are not being used
- For example, specifying 16 days would add up to a total of 30 days

Additional detail:
- ComputerLoginCheck also references the date that the computerâ€™s password was changed. ComputerLoginCheck checks to ensure the password has been set within the last 45 days. Changing the computer password (technically called the machine account password) is an automatic process that does not and should not require manual intervention.
- ComputerLoginCheck will automatically exclude all Domain Controllers in the domain.
- The DisableUnusedComputers parameter refers to computers that do not have the lastLogonTimestamp and operatingSystem attributes.
